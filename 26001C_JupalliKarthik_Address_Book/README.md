# Address Book

A simple C-based address book application for managing contacts. The program supports creating, searching, editing, deleting, listing, and marking favorite contacts. Contact data is persisted in `contacts.txt`, so information is preserved between program runs.

- Add new contacts with name, phone number, email, and favorite status
- Search contacts by name, phone number, or email
- Edit existing contact details
- Delete contacts
- List all saved contacts in a formatted table
- View favorite contacts and categorize them as Friend, Family, or Others
- Automatic data persistence in `contacts.txt`
- Input validation for names, phone numbers, and emails
